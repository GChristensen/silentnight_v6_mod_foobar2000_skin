# Silent Night v6 Mod by gchristnsn

This is a modification of the original Silent Night V.6 foobar2000 skin by [Arnie77](http://arnie77.deviantart.com/art/Silent-Night-V-6-154667359) and [lorddarkkinght](http://lorddarknight.deviantart.com/art/Silent-Night-v6-2-687027257).

The skin could be useful if you prefer a well-structured file-system tree over the media library to access and categorize your music.

### Differences from the original version

- [Modified Explorer Tree](https://github.com/GChristensen/foo_uie_explorer_mod) is used instead of the media library filter. 
- Additional component for [bookmarking](http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=46612&amp;hl=).
- [Masstagger](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_masstag).
- Playlist scrollbar is visible by default (when required).

WARNING: some services use German language by default (this setting is left unchanged from the original skin).

### Installation: same as for the original Silent Night

- Install foobar2000 using the portable mode with all options (full installation).
- Merge skin and foobar2000 folders content **before the first foobar launch**.
- Select **Columns UI** after the first launch.

See manuals at the distribution for more details.

### Known issues

- Horizontal file explorer panel orientation is a little buggy (it's may be necessary to resize window to rid of glitches).
- Some antivirus may bark at Soundmixer.exe (you may safely delete it).
